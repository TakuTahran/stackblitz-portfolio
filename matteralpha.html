        <h2>Automation News publishing Website</h2>
        <p>
          As the home automation industry rapidly evolves, enthusiasts and
          homeowners are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with the
          latest trends, products, and innovations. Existing news platforms
          often lack the depth, organization, and user-friendly design necessary
          to effectively convey this information. Users are looking for a
          dedicated, comprehensive, and visually appealing source that provides
          timely, relevant, and easily accessible content on home automation.
        </p>
        <h2>Challenges Identified</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Information Overload: Users struggle to find relevant and up-to-date
            information amidst a plethora of scattered and poorly organized
            content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Poor User Experience: Many existing websites lack intuitive
            navigation, making it difficult for users to locate specific
            information or browse categories effortlessly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inadequate Visual Appeal: The design of current platforms often
            fails to reflect the innovative nature of the home automation
            industry, resulting in a lack of engagement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content Accessibility: Users require a responsive design that offers
            a seamless experience across various devices, from desktops to
            mobile phones.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Design a news website that effectively communicates the latest in
            home automation
          </li>
          <li>Ensure an human and enjoyable user experience.</li>

            Ensure the design can be re used if they brand decides to pivot
