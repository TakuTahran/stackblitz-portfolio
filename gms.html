          GiveMeSport.com is a leading sports news website aiming to increase
          user engagement. This case study explores the development and impact
          of a new live match day reporting feature with key statistics.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          While GiveMeSport.com offers a variety of sports content, user
          engagement suffers during non-live events. Traditional post-match
          reports lack the immediacy and excitement of live games.

          Develop a live match day reporting feature that provides real-time
          updates, commentary, and key statistics for major sporting events.
          This feature integrates with existing functionalities like news
          articles and social media feeds to create a comprehensive user
